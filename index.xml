      <description>I have been the music director for Perfect Fifth since Fall 2014. Perfect Fifth is a small student a cappella choir specializing in the music of the Renaissance, but our repertoire ranges from the beginnings of western polyphonic music in the Middle Ages all the way to contemporary art music. While it previously relied on directorial support from the University of California Choral Ensembles (ably provided by Mark Sumner), under my tenure Perfect Fifth has shifted to being fully self-run.</description>

      <description>Asymmetric Identities: Identity-Driven Polarization and Evaluative Schemas Politics does not need to be a fair fight; in fact, the two sides don&amp;rsquo;t even need to be having the same fight at all. This fact is well apparent in the study of elite polarization, which is nearly unanimously recognized as asymmetric in favor of Republicans. It is also beginning to be recognized in the study of mass polarization, but there is as yet no systematic, large-scale, investigation of asymmetry in mass polarization.</description>

      <description>I have extensive experience teaching both within the university and outside of it. I have five years of experience as a Graduate Student Instructor at UC Berkeley, teaching sections for a wide variety of courses, from Intro to Sociology and Intro Methods to upper level courses including both those focused on particular topic areas (i.e. Urban Sociology or Sexual Cultures) and the department&amp;rsquo;s year long Introduction to Sociological Theory. This semester I am particularly excited to be a Writing GSI and have the chance to focus on writing skills and close one-on-one work with students in a way which time constraints make difficult in other teaching roles.</description>
