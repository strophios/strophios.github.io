<h1 id="strangers-in-their-own-party-dissatisfied-partisans-and-the-worldview-model-of-polarization">Strangers in their Own Party: Dissatisfied Partisans and the Worldview Model of Polarization</h1>
<p>The Republican Party’s rejection of the outcome of the 2020 presidential election is nearly unprecedented in modern American politics, but there is one way that it is unremarkable: it has no Democratic equivalent. Rather, it is only the most extreme example of the apparently asymmetric nature of polarization over the last forty years. However, current work on mass polarization neither captures nor explains this asymmetry. In this paper, I bring together sociological work on cultural schemas, recent advances in the study of <em>attitudinal</em> polarization, and core insights on the role of <em>affective</em> polarization from political science, to propose a new theory which can and does: the worldview model of polarization. By defining polarization in terms of persistent patterned relationships between partisan affect, perceptions of threat, and feelings of fear, I am able to approach asymmetry as a question not only of degree, but of <em>kind</em>. Using data from the 1978-2016 ANES, I not only clearly demonstrate that Republicans are indeed significantly more polarized at the mass level, but also suggest a mechanism for this asymmetry, namely, that Republicans are caught in a radicalizing feedback loop of fear of the opposition and dissatisfaction with their own party’s response to that perceived threat. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h1 id="solidarity-and-strife-democracies-in-a-time-of-pandemic">Solidarity and Strife: Democracies in a Time of Pandemic</h1>
<p>In 2020, I was made a research fellow with the <a href="https://matrix.berkeley.edu/initiatives/solidarity-and-strife-democracies-time-pandemic/">Solidarity and Strife</a> project, a collaboration between the <a href="https://matrix.berkeley.edu/">Social Science Matrix</a> and the <a href="https://dlab.berkeley.edu/">D-Lab</a> which aimed to use social media data to take &ldquo;a comparative approach to assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on political polarization and solidarity in the United States and the United Kingdom, two nations governed by populist leaders who initially denied the seriousness of the viral outbreak.&rdquo; My research from this project is still ongoing, but it attempts to use an extensive Twitter dataset to investigate exactly how polarization began and developed in conversations around COVID-19. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h1 id="negative-partisanship-is-not-enough-affective-polarization-partisan-asymmetry-and-a-failed-theory-contest">Negative Partisanship is Not Enough: Affective Polarization, Partisan Asymmetry, and a Failed Theory Contest</h1>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There&rsquo;s a nascent debate in the study of polarization which this paper aims to break open: from the start, the study of affective polarization has been somewhat split between two approaches: one looking at net bias (i.e. the difference between in/out party affective evaluation) and the other focusing solely on negative out-party affect (more recently highlighted under the label of <em>negative partisanship</em>). However, the differences between these approaches have yet to truly be reckoned with: whether in-party affect plays a significant role in affective polarization at all or, conversely, whether negative partisanship is a clean replacement for affective polarization per se, are still open and under-investigated question (although there is a growing literature addressing, at least, the differential roles of in and out-party affect). This paper uses the empirical investigation of whether mass polarization is asymmetric to show that these approaches are, in fact, not compatible, and furthermore that neither is really sufficient to the task of capturing polarization. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<h1 id="immigrant-contentious-action-collective-action-domains-and-the-modern-pre-history-of-the-pro-immigrant-social-movement-1960-1995">Immigrant Contentious Action: Collective Action Domains and the Modern Pre-History of the Pro-Immigrant Social Movement, 1960-1995</h1>
<p>Social movement scholars have paid relatively little attention to the contentious action of immigrants living in the United States, both in their empirical research and their theorizing. Scholars of migration are beginning to provide rich accounts of pro-immigrant contentious action, but they have largely focused on the 21st century. To the extent that they trace the roots of contemporary mobilization, there are conflicting accounts over the extent and periodization of immigrant protest in prior decades. We ask three questions: Have social movement scholars not studied immigrant mobilization because, until recently, immigrant protest was minimal compared to other iconic movements? Second, to the extent that immigrants did mobilize, was this largely a phenomenon in the U.S. Southwest, linked to Chicanx and agricultural labor organizing? We explore the existence and scope of pro-immigrant collective action from 1960 to 1995 using the Dynamics of Collective Action dataset, engaging in new, original coding of Immigrant Collective Action events. We distinguish four distinct <em>domains</em> of collective action, which we label diaspora, documentation, access, and exclusionary protest. We find that immigrant protest events were as prevalent and disruptive in these years as collective action in the name of other movements that figure prominently in social movements scholarship and theory and we identify evidence of widespread action by a range of national-origin groups across the country, including the U.S. South. We conclude that the scholarly inattention to immigrant collective action reflects conceptual blindness rather than empirical absence and we draw out the implications for the scholarship on social movements and immigration. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<h1 id="speaking-sociology-the-problem-of-polysemy-and-the-solution-of-metaphor">Speaking Sociology: The Problem of Polysemy and the Solution of Metaphor</h1>
<p>Doing good sociology is hard, this goes without saying. But the specifically <em>semantic</em> or communicative dimension of this difficulty is often ignored. We sometimes imagine sociology as a diverse discipline in which crosscutting perspectives and methods collide in strange and exciting conversations, but in reality an outsider would be forgiven for thinking that sociology only <em>purports</em> to be a single discipline, as these semantic difficulties too often create misunderstandings and see our conversations siloed off. Building on Abend&rsquo;s (2008) recognition of the problem of polysemy in theory, I show that the problem is far more general, impacting every corner of the discipline. Previous solutions, while helpful, have been insufficient because they lack an adequate theoretical understanding of communication. However, the philosophical, linguistic, and cognitive study of metaphor can provide just such a foundation. Building on this foundation, I detail a practical solution, which I dub metaphorical reading, and I demonstrate its utility with a series of practical examples.</p>
