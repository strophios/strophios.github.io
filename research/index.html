<h1 id="beyond-the-structure-of-attitudes-belief-systems-affect-and-polarization">Beyond the Structure of Attitudes: Belief Systems, Affect, and Polarization</h1>
<p>Despite the recognition of the importance of affect elsewhere (including in much work on polarization), work on public opinion and belief systems has so far looked only at propositional attitudes. But, as seen in the worldview model of polarization, the connections between propositional attitudes and affective judgments are of central importance to the actual function of any given belief system (or worldview). Through a novel application of Boutyline and Vaisey&rsquo;s belief network analysis, this paper demonstrate this importance in a new way. Using data from the American National Election Studies, I compare the belief networks in 1992 and 2016. But beyond examining only the network of propositional beliefs, I also look at the network of affective items, as well as the combined network of both attitudes and affects. In this way I show, first, that the different kinds of networks are similar enough to be comparable, but different enough to provide analytical leverage; and second, that the integration of affects and beliefs has changed over time, in line with polarization. Ultimately, I argue that we must incorporate affects into our study of belief systems and, furthermore, that the nature of this incorporation is itself a meaningful axis of variation. These findings are not only important methodologically for the study of belief structures, they are substantively consequential for the study of polarization, offering a way towards reconciling affective and attitudinal approaches by  defining polarization in terms of the increasing integration of emotion and attitude.</p>

<h1 id="does-an-equity-minded-organization-produce-equity-minded-science-the-matthew-effect-in-nsf-advance-publications">Does an Equity-Minded Organization Produce Equity-Minded Science? The Matthew Effect in NSF ADVANCE Publications</h1>
<p>The role of the Matthew effect, i.e., cumulative advantage, in the deep citational inequality in science is widely recognized. While some degree of citational inequality is a necessary consequence of science&rsquo;s meritocratic aspirations, an excess hinders both the careers of individual researchers as well as the progress of science itself. As such, understanding how to moderate this inequality is of prime importance. We address this issue through the study of a unique least likely case: the NSF&rsquo;s ADVANCE program and its engagement with women&rsquo;s and gender studies. Expecting less inequality here than in science more broadly, we instead find, through an analysis of citations across ADVANCE solicitations, successful ADVANCE proposals, and ADVANCE award funded research, and by drawing on recent advances in network modeling, the same citational inequality driven by the Matthew effect. At the same time, though, linking solicitations, proposals, and research allows us to demonstrate just how the NSF&rsquo;s interventions in knowledge production have or have not had an impact. In this way, we show both how endemic the Matthew effect is and how the NSF, or other funding organizations, could act to more effectively structure the field.</p>

<h1 id="polar-opposites-real-and-imagined-differences-in-partisan-candidate-evaluation">Polar Opposites: Real and Imagined Differences in Partisan Candidate Evaluation</h1>
<p>Political scholars are grappling with the causes and consequences of political polarization in U.S. politics. One area of great concern is related to voting behavior, especially in an era of uncivil politics. As candidates eschew norms of decorum for uncivil tactics (e.g. insulting opponents or spreading misinformation), voters find themselves electing uncivil candidates and long-held beliefs about voters’ motivations are called into question. What remains unclear from existing literature is how (1) how Americans justify choosing an uncivil in-party candidate; (2) what information Americans will leverage when forced to choose between two in-party candidates that vary in their uncivil behavior; and (3) how Americans judge civil out-party candidates; and (4) how do respondents leverage candidate race and gender in their justifications? This research measures systematic differences in the way Americans evaluate civil and uncivil in-party and out-party candidates. This study puts into conversation three important trends in political sociological scholarship: (a) the identification of voter motivations; (b) the foundational question of in-party affect versus out-party animus; (c) voters’ response to candidate incivility. We do so by applying automated text analysis techniques to more than 10,000 survey write-in responses from 1,737 U.S. adults. In our preliminary results, we identify important themes from the responses. First, partisan alignment is the deciding factor for most respondents. Second, when partisan alignment cannot be the deciding factor (when respondents are choosing between two in-party or out-party candidates), respondents tend to weigh the relative incivility of the candidates as well as perceived candidate quality based on experience and candidate demographics. Our findings suggest that voters are choosing uncivil candidates with open eyes – recognizing that partisan alignment is more important than candidates’ behavior during campaigns.</p>

<h1 id="privacy-in-public-the-ethics-of-academic-research-with-publicly-available-social-media-data">Privacy in Public? The Ethics of Academic Research with Publicly Available Social Media Data</h1>
<p>The public nature of social media data has been an incredible boon to researchers across disciplines, providing access to a previously impossible quantity and (in certain respects) quality of data. Part of the attraction of this data is that it has traditionally traditionally been understood as exempt from the ethical and regulatory responsibilities applied to purpose-collected or otherwise private data. However, the very attributes which make this data uniquely useful also raise unique ethical challenges. This paper attempts to explore those challenges and their implications for researchers by working through the differences between &ldquo;public on the internet&rdquo; and &ldquo;public in physical space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We focus in particular on what these differences mean for the social media users we study and ground our evaluation of harms in the perspective of researchers&rsquo; &ldquo;duty of care&rdquo; towards those users whose data we collect. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the institutional and regulatory frameworks governing the use of such data. These are the mechanisms through which any possible solutions must function, but they are not as yet suited to the task. We close with recommendations for moving forward, attempting to strike a reasonable balance between ethical ideals and scientific realities. We empirically explore the conflict between users&rsquo; interest in controlling their online self-presentation and researchers&rsquo; interest in maintaining a durable record by checking the continued availability of previously collected tweets. We find a large proportion of deleted and private tweets, demonstrating a relatively common desire to opt-out of future, and presumably therefore previous, study. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the institutional and regulatory frameworks governing the use of such data. These are the mechanisms through which any possible solutions must function, but they are not as yet suited to the task. We close with recommendations for moving forward, attempting to strike a reasonable balance between ethical ideals and scientific realities.</p>

<h1 id="inactive-and-quiescent-immigrant-collective-action-in-comparative-perspective-1960-1995">Inactive and quiescent? Immigrant Collective Action in Comparative Perspective, 1960-1995</h1>
<p>Social movement mobilization by and on behalf of immigrants occurs frequently today, but sociologists have been slow to include immigrant collective action in the canon of social movement or immigration scholarship. Is this because, until recently, immigrant protest was minimal compared to iconic movements? When immigrants did mobilize, was contention limited to the U.S. Southwest and tied to Chicanx and farm labor organizing? We analyze the existence and scope of pro-immigrant collective action from 1960 to 1995 using the Dynamics of Contention dataset, developing an original coding of immigrant collective action events. We find that immigrant contention was as prevalent and disruptive as collective action in the name of prominent movements of this period, it occurred among a range of national-origin groups, and it happened nation-wide, including in the South.</p>

<h1 id="strangers-in-their-own-party-dissatisfied-partisans-and-the-worldview-model-of-polarization">Strangers in their Own Party: Dissatisfied Partisans and the Worldview Model of Polarization</h1>
<p>The Republican Party’s rejection of the outcome of the 2020 presidential election is nearly unprecedented in modern American politics, but there is one way that it is unremarkable: it has no Democratic equivalent. Rather, it is only the most extreme example of the apparently asymmetric nature of polarization over the last forty years. However, current work on mass polarization neither captures nor explains this asymmetry. In this paper, I bring together sociological work on cultural schemas, recent advances in the study of <em>attitudinal</em> polarization, and core insights on the role of <em>affective</em> polarization from political science, to propose a new theory which can and does: the worldview model of polarization. By defining polarization in terms of persistent patterned relationships between partisan affect, perceptions of threat, and feelings of fear, I am able to approach asymmetry as a question not only of degree, but of <em>kind</em>. Using data from the 1978-2016 ANES, I not only clearly demonstrate that Republicans are indeed significantly more polarized at the mass level, but also suggest a mechanism for this asymmetry, namely, that Republicans are caught in a radicalizing feedback loop of fear of the opposition and dissatisfaction with their own party’s response to that perceived threat.</p>
<h1 id="negative-partisanship-is-not-enough-affective-polarization-partisan-asymmetry-and-a-failed-theory-contest">Negative Partisanship is Not Enough: Affective Polarization, Partisan Asymmetry, and a Failed Theory Contest</h1>
<p>Despite the increasingly obvious centrality of affective polarization to American politics, a foundational question remains unresolved: from the start, some work has defined polarization solely in terms of out-party animus, while others have seen both in- and out-party affect as constitutive. In this paper, I test these approaches on the question of whether mass polarization is asymmetric: given evidence at the elite and organizational levels, we expect Republicans to be more polarized than Democrats, and these two definitions create clearly different expectations for how that asymmetry should look. However, this apparently neat theory contest fails. Using data from the American National Election Studies, I look at how affective polarization developed from 1978–2016 and find asymmetry toward Democrats, driven almost entirely by in-party affect. These findings are anomalous for both theories, and I argue that they disrupt our basic assumption of a straightforward link between affect, identity, and polarization.</p>

<p>In 2020, I was made a research fellow with the <a href="https://matrix.berkeley.edu/initiatives/solidarity-and-strife-democracies-time-pandemic/">Solidarity and Strife</a> project, a collaboration between the <a href="https://matrix.berkeley.edu/">Social Science Matrix</a> and the <a href="https://dlab.berkeley.edu/">D-Lab</a> which aimed to use social media data to take &ldquo;a comparative approach to assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on political polarization and solidarity in the United States and the United Kingdom, two nations governed by populist leaders who initially denied the seriousness of the viral outbreak.&rdquo; My research from this project is still ongoing, but it attempts to use an extensive Twitter dataset to investigate exactly how polarization began and developed in conversations around COVID-19. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h1 id="speaking-sociology-the-problem-of-polysemy-and-the-solution-of-metaphor">Speaking Sociology: The Problem of Polysemy and the Solution of Metaphor</h1>
<p>Doing good sociology is hard, this goes without saying. But the specifically <em>semantic</em> or communicative dimension of this difficulty is often ignored. We sometimes imagine sociology as a diverse discipline in which crosscutting perspectives and methods collide in strange and exciting conversations, but in reality an outsider would be forgiven for thinking that sociology only <em>purports</em> to be a single discipline, as these semantic difficulties too often create misunderstandings and see our conversations siloed off. Building on Abend&rsquo;s (2008) recognition of the problem of polysemy in theory, I show that the problem is far more general, impacting every corner of the discipline. Previous solutions, while helpful, have been insufficient because they lack an adequate theoretical understanding of communication. However, the philosophical, linguistic, and cognitive study of metaphor can provide just such a foundation. Building on this foundation, I detail a practical solution, which I dub metaphorical reading, and I demonstrate its utility with a series of practical examples.</p>
