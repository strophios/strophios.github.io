<h1 id="strangers-in-their-own-party-dissatisfied-partisans-and-the-worldview-model-of-polarization">Strangers in their Own Party: Dissatisfied Partisans and the Worldview Model of Polarization</h1>
<p>The Republican Party’s rejection of the outcome of the 2020 presidential election is nearly unprecedented in modern American politics, but there is one way that it is unremarkable: it has no Democratic equivalent. Rather, it is only the most extreme example of the apparently asymmetric nature of polarization over the last forty years. However, current work on mass polarization neither captures nor explains this asymmetry. In this paper, I bring together sociological work on cultural schemas, recent advances in the study of <em>attitudinal</em> polarization, and core insights on the role of <em>affective</em> polarization from political science, to propose a new theory which can and does: the worldview model of polarization. By defining polarization in terms of persistent patterned relationships between partisan affect, perceptions of threat, and feelings of fear, I am able to approach asymmetry as a question not only of degree, but of <em>kind</em>. Using data from the 1978-2016 ANES, I not only clearly demonstrate that Republicans are indeed significantly more polarized at the mass level, but also suggest a mechanism for this asymmetry, namely, that Republicans are caught in a radicalizing feedback loop of fear of the opposition and dissatisfaction with their own party’s response to that perceived threat.</p>
<h1 id="negative-partisanship-is-not-enough-affective-polarization-partisan-asymmetry-and-a-failed-theory-contest">Negative Partisanship is Not Enough: Affective Polarization, Partisan Asymmetry, and a Failed Theory Contest</h1>
<p>The central role of polarization in American politics is undeniable, as is its specifically affective dimension. However, studies of affective polarization leave unresolved a foundational question about the role of in-party affect: from the start, some work has defined polarization solely in terms of out-party animus, while others have seen both in- and out-party affect as constitutive. In this paper, I attempt to test these approaches on the question of whether mass polarization is asymmetric: given asymmetries at the elite and organizational levels, we expect Republicans to be more polarized than Democrats, but these two theories of affective polarization have clearly different expectations for what the asymmetry looks like. However, this apparently neat theory contest fails. Using data from the American National Election Studies, I look at how affective polarization developed from 1978-2016 and I find that <em>Democrats</em> are more polarized, but that that difference is driven by in-party affect (while out-party animus isn&rsquo;t asymmetric). These findings are anomalous for both theories, and I argue that they should disrupt the basic assumption of a straightforward link between affect, identity, and polarization.</p>
<h1 id="beyond-the-structure-of-attitudes-belief-systems-affect-and-polarization">Beyond the Structure of Attitudes: Belief Systems, Affect, and Polarization</h1>
<p>Despite the recognition of the importance of affect elsewhere (including in much work on polarization), work on public opinion and belief systems has so far looked only at propositional attitudes. But, as seen in the worldview model of polarization, the connections between propositional attitudes and affective judgments are of central importance to the actual function of any given belief system (or worldview). Through a novel application of Boutyline and Vaisey&rsquo;s belief network analysis, this paper demonstrate this importance in a new way. Using data from the American National Election Studies, I compare the belief networks in 1992 and 2016. But beyond examining only the network of propositional beliefs, I also look at the network of affective items, as well as the combined network of both attitudes and affects. In this way I show, first, that the different kinds of networks are similar enough to be comparable, but different enough to provide analytical leverage; and second, that the integration of affects and beliefs has changed over time, in line with polarization. Ultimately, I argue that we must incorporate affects into our study of belief systems and, furthermore, that the nature of this incorporation is itself a meaningful axis of variation. These findings are not only important methodologically for the study of belief structures, they are substantively consequential for the study of polarization, offering a way towards reconciling affective and attitudinal approaches by  defining polarization in terms of the increasing integration of emotion and attitude.</p>
<h1 id="immigrant-collective--action-domains-of-contention-and-the-pre-history-of-the-pro-immigrant-social-movement-1960-1995">Immigrant Collective  Action: Domains of Contention and the Pre-History of the Pro-Immigrant Social Movement, 1960-1995</h1>
<p>Social movement mobilization by and on behalf of immigrants occurs frequently today, but sociologists have been slow to include immigrant collective action in the canon of social movement or immigration scholarship. Is this because, until recently, immigrant protest was minimal compared to iconic movements? When immigrants did mobilize, was contention limited to the U.S. Southwest and tied to Chicanx and farm labor organizing? We analyze the existence and scope of pro-immigrant collective action from 1960 to 1995 using the Dynamics of Contention dataset, developing an original coding of immigrant collective action events. We find that immigrant contention was as prevalent and disruptive as collective action in the name of prominent movements of this period, it occurred among a range of national-origin groups, and it happened nation-wide, including in the South. Our analysis reveals four <em>domains</em> of action: diasporic, documentation, access, and exclusionary contention. Domains are differentiated by key issues, temporal trends, targets, tactics and those involved. Prior inattention to immigrant collective action likely stems from disregard for the categorical inequality of noncitizenship, the tendency to study movements after they consolidate rather than considering populations &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; for collective action, and a neglect of transnationally-oriented protest.</p>

<h1 id="solidarity-and-strife-democracies-in-a-time-of-pandemic">Solidarity and Strife: Democracies in a Time of Pandemic</h1>
<p>In 2020, I was made a research fellow with the <a href="https://matrix.berkeley.edu/initiatives/solidarity-and-strife-democracies-time-pandemic/">Solidarity and Strife</a> project, a collaboration between the <a href="https://matrix.berkeley.edu/">Social Science Matrix</a> and the <a href="https://dlab.berkeley.edu/">D-Lab</a> which aimed to use social media data to take &ldquo;a comparative approach to assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on political polarization and solidarity in the United States and the United Kingdom, two nations governed by populist leaders who initially denied the seriousness of the viral outbreak.&rdquo; My research from this project is still ongoing, but it attempts to use an extensive Twitter dataset to investigate exactly how polarization began and developed in conversations around COVID-19. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h1 id="speaking-sociology-the-problem-of-polysemy-and-the-solution-of-metaphor">Speaking Sociology: The Problem of Polysemy and the Solution of Metaphor</h1>
<p>Doing good sociology is hard, this goes without saying. But the specifically <em>semantic</em> or communicative dimension of this difficulty is often ignored. We sometimes imagine sociology as a diverse discipline in which crosscutting perspectives and methods collide in strange and exciting conversations, but in reality an outsider would be forgiven for thinking that sociology only <em>purports</em> to be a single discipline, as these semantic difficulties too often create misunderstandings and see our conversations siloed off. Building on Abend&rsquo;s (2008) recognition of the problem of polysemy in theory, I show that the problem is far more general, impacting every corner of the discipline. Previous solutions, while helpful, have been insufficient because they lack an adequate theoretical understanding of communication. However, the philosophical, linguistic, and cognitive study of metaphor can provide just such a foundation. Building on this foundation, I detail a practical solution, which I dub metaphorical reading, and I demonstrate its utility with a series of practical examples.</p>
